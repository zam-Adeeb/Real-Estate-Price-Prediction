# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
# 🏠 Real Estate Price Prediction - Bengaluru

This project is a machine learning-based application that predicts the approximate price of a residential property in Bengaluru, India. By providing key details like location, square footage (sqft), number of bedrooms (BHK), and number of bathrooms, the model estimates the property's market price.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can help users estimate the price of a property in Bengaluru using historical housing data. This can assist buyers, sellers, and agents in making informed decisions based on real-time insights.
